# Week 6 JavaScript Lab

Each of the "days" of this lab are in their own folder. Each folder contains three files: `index.html`, `event-listners.js`, and `script.js`. You will only need to modify the `script.js` files for each day. If you are interested in how to make the buttons work, feel free to examine the other two files.


Start each day by opening the `index.html` file for the day in your Live Server. You will see buttons. The buttons are labeled Part1A and Part1B. The "A" part is down as an example for you. The "B" part is for you do complete on your own. (You may base your work on the examples given.)

You will find the code for each button in the `script.js` file. The "Part A" functions are examples for you to refer to. They show you a few things you can do with JavaScript. For "Part B," you will replicate what you saw in "Part A" with a slight twist.

The activities start easier and get more difficult. "Parts 1," "2" and "3" only require a slight change. If you can understand how they work, you will have the tools necessary to create a significant project on your own. The "Bonus" at the end of each "day" represents a real-world application of JavaScript you might want to include in your webpage. You are strongly encouraged to try the Bonus challange at the end of each "day" or to create your own ideas and implement them using the JavaScript you learned that "day."
